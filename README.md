# SecureScope

**SecureScope** is a full-stack vulnerability scanner designed to provide comprehensive security insights by scanning networks, web applications, and hosts for potential vulnerabilities. This project leverages industry-standard technologies to offer real-time updates, detailed reporting, and a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features
- **Network-Based Scanning**: Identifies open ports, exposed services, and network misconfigurations.
- **Web Application Scanning**: Detects common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and authentication issues.
- **Host-Based Scanning**: Inspects machines for outdated software, misconfigurations, and unpatched vulnerabilities.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Users can monitor scan progress in real-time via WebSockets.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports, categorizing vulnerabilities by severity, with remediation suggestions.
- **User Authentication & Role-Based Access**: Secure login with role-based access control for scan management and results review.
- **Scalability**: Built using Docker and Kubernetes for easy deployment and scalability in production environments.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: 
  - React.js
  - TypeScript
  - Material-UI for responsive design
- **Back-End**: 
  - Node.js with Express
  - Python for scan logic
  - GraphQL API
- **Database**: 
  - PostgreSQL for structured data
  - MongoDB for unstructured data (logs)
- **Real-Time**: 
  - WebSockets for live updates
  - RabbitMQ or Kafka for task management
- **DevOps**: 
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for orchestration
  - AWS/Google Cloud for cloud deployment
- **Security**: 
  - JWT for authentication
  - SSL/TLS for secure communication
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
